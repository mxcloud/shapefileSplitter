# Congressional District Shape File Splitter

For later use I want to show the individual congressional districts over a period of time. I am able to retrieve all the congressional districts from http://cdmaps.polisci.ucla.edu/, but they come all lumped in a large 50 MB files for each congressional term.

I am using Python and qGis 2.18 to break down the congressional districts of each term into their own individual GeoJSON file that will be later used for the website GerryMapper.

### Prerequisites

```
qGis 2.18
Python 2.7 or 3.6
```

## Deployment

Use this script within the Qgis 2.18 Python Console
